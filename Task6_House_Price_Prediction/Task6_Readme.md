# 🏡 Task 6: House Price Prediction

This project is part of the **DevelopersHub AI/ML Internship**.  
It involves predicting house prices based on various property features such as area, bedrooms, bathrooms, and location using regression modeling. The notebook demonstrates a complete machine learning pipeline with EDA, data preprocessing, model building, evaluation, and visualization.

---

## 🎯 Objective

- Predict the selling price of a house based on key features  
- Train and evaluate regression models for accurate prediction  
- Perform proper feature scaling, encoding, and cleaning  
- Visualize relationships and model predictions  

---

## 💡 Key Features

- Uses the `yasserh/housing-prices-dataset` from Kaggle  
- Includes full EDA: correlation matrix, histograms, boxplots, and scatter plots  
- Data cleaning: handles categorical variables and standardizes inputs  
- Feature engineering: new features like price per bedroom, price per square foot  
- Regression models used:  
  - Linear Regression  
  - Gradient Boosting Regressor  
- Evaluation with **MAE**, **RMSE**, and **R² Score**  
- Predicted vs Actual price comparison with line plots  

---

## 📋 Sample Features Used

- Area (square feet)  
- Number of Bedrooms  
- Number of Bathrooms  
- Parking Availability  
- Furnishing Status  
- Location (encoded)

## ⚙️ How to Run (Step-by-Step)

### Step 1: Clone the Repo  
Clone the repository and open the notebook in Jupyter or Colab.

### Step 2: Install Dependencies  
Ensure you have all necessary libraries:
- `pandas`, `numpy`, `matplotlib`, `seaborn`  
- `scikit-learn`  
- Optional: `kagglehub` for direct dataset access

### Step 3: Load the Dataset  
Load `Housing.csv` from the Kaggle dataset `yasserh/housing-prices-dataset`.

### Step 4: Clean and Explore the Data  
Handle missing values, convert categoricals, and visualize feature distributions.

### Step 5: Train the Models  
Split the data and train Linear Regression and Gradient Boosting models.

### Step 6: Evaluate the Models  
Compare performance using metrics and plots for both models.
